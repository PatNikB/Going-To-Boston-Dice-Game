# Going-To-Boston-Dice-Game
C# Program
Each player in turn has three throws of the dice.  On the first throw, the highest number is put to one side.  If two or more dice show the highest number, only one is kept.  The remaining two dice are thrown again and the highest is put aside once more.  The final die is rolled and the total of all three is the player's score.  The player with the highest score, after each player has had a turn, wins that round.  A set number of rounds are played and the player who takes the most is the overall winner.
